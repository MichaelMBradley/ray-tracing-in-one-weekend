# Ray Tracing in One Weekend - Rust

This is my attempt at a Rust implementation of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/) by Peter Shirley and editors.

I am aware that many of the features I implement by hand have better alternatives easily available via crates.io, but part of my goal for this project is to get a better grasp of Rust so it helps me to re-invent the wheel.

This also took more than 1 weekend because I procrastinated lol

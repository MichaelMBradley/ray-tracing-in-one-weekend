# Ray Tracing in One Weekend - Rust

This is my attempt at a Rust implementation of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/) by Peter Shirley and editors.

I am aware that many of the features I implement by hand have better alternatives easily available via crates.io, but part of my goal for this project is to get a better grasp of Rust so it helps me to re-invent the wheel.

This also took more than 1 weekend because I procrastinated lol

## Update

Made it to the end of chapter 8, and I'm happy with what I've learned and read from future chapters.
I've been following the book closely, and seeing how trying to port and Rust-ify (tested) C++ code doesn't make the compiler happy is illuminating.
Looking forward to starting from scratch on a new ray tracing project.
